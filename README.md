# Using the IBM Blockchain PoT Pages repository

## Overview
This repository gets "built" every time a commit is done against the master branch.  The main content page is index.md, and is designed to not change very often; only when content that is independent of a specific event or location needs to be updated or added should index.md get updated.

When the project gets built, it will scan all the files in the locations directory and if the "location" property is set to true and the "visible" property is set to true that location page will show up in the list of locations on the main page in the form of a link to the location-specific page.

## Adding a location
To add a location:
- create a branch from the `master` branch
- add your location file by copying the template location page `locationtemplate.md`.  Rename it to something unique.
- make sure the `title` property at the top describes your location name
- change the `visible` property to true.
- commit your changes to your branch
- submit a Pull Request to get your branch merged to the `master` branch

When the Pull Request is completed the site will be rebuilt and your location will show up.
